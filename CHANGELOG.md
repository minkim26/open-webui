### Added

- 📋 **Copy Formatted Response Mode**: You can now enable “Copy Formatted” in Settings > Interface to copy AI responses exactly as styled (with rich formatting, links, and structure preserved), making it faster and cleaner to paste into documents, emails, or reports.
- ⚙️ **Backend Stability and Performance Enhancements**: General backend refactoring improves system resilience, consistency, and overall reliability—offering smoother performance across workflows whether chatting, generating media, or using external tools.
- 🌎 **Translation Refinements Across Multiple Languages**: Updated translations deliver smoother language localization, clearer labels, and improved international usability throughout the UI—ensuring a better experience for non-English speakers.
